# My_projects
Here are the codes of my projects

In the Churn.ipynb I implemented binary classification in order to find out whether a customer will leave or not.

In the kMeans_clustering.ipynb I implemented kMeans clustering on an image and figured out the most suitable number of classes using the elbow and silhouette methods on artificial data

In the DOTA2_prediction.ipynb my groupmate and I worked on a dataset from Kaggle, we were to conduct binary classification, that is to predict whether a team will win the match or not. We implemented some basic classification algorithms and then introduced some feature-engineering to improve the performance.
